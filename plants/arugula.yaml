common_name: Arugula
family: Brassicaceae
type: leafy green
description: >
  Arugula is a fast-growing, peppery salad green. It prefers cool to moderate temperatures and moderate light; very high heat causes bolting and increases pungency.

stages:
  - name: seedling
    duration_days: [4, 10]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [50, 150]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [6, 12]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [1.5, 3]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [5, 22]
    photoperiod_hours: [10, 14]
    ec_mS_cm: [0.8, 1.4]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Fast turnover crop; sowing intervals of 7â€“14 days maintain continuous harvest. Cooler temps reduce bolting.

  - name: vegetative
    duration_days: [10, 25]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [100, 300]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [12, 20]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [2, 4]

    ec_mS_cm: [1.0, 1.8]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Harvest as baby leaves or larger; increased light intensifies pungency and leaf thickness.

  - name: mature
    duration_days: [20, 60]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [150, 400]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [14, 28]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [3, 6]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [5, 26]
    photoperiod_hours: [10, 16]
    ec_mS_cm: [1.2, 2.0]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Warm temperatures accelerate bolting; provide shade or cooler environment to extend harvest window.
