latin_name: Solanum lycopersicum
common_name: Tomatoes
varieties: ["cherry", "Tiny Tim", "Micro-Tom", "Red Robin"]
family: Solanaceae
type: fruiting plant
description: >
  Tomatoes require high light and warm temperatures for fruit set and sugar accumulation. Dwarf and micro varieties like Tiny Tim and Micro-Tom are well-suited to container and indoor production.

      High light and stable warm temps promote fruit set and sugar accumulation. Manage humidity to reduce disease risk; hand-pollinate or provide airflow for pollination in indoor settings.
