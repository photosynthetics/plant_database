  Thyme is a hardy, low-growing herb used in cooking and aromatherapy. It tolerates slightly lower light than some tender herbs but still responds well to steady, moderate-intensity artificial lighting.

stages:
  - name: seedling
    duration_days: [7, 14]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [50, 120]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [3, 6]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [0.8, 1.5]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [18, 24]
    photoperiod_hours: [12, 16]
    ec_mS_cm: [0.8, 1.4]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Keep substrate lightly moist; thyme seedlings prefer slightly cooler temperatures than basil.

  - name: vegetative
    duration_days: [30, 60]

      Provide good airflow and moderate light intensity; prune to encourage bushiness.

  - name: mature

    notes: >
      Thyme is fairly drought tolerant once established; reduce photoperiod slightly for flower induction if desired.
