latin_name: Spinacia oleracea
common_name: Spinach
family: Amaranthaceae
type: leafy green
description: >
  Spinach prefers cool temperatures and moderate light; tolerates low light but yields and leaf thickness improve under moderate PPFD.

    notes: >
      Cool-season crop; watch for bolting in warm conditions.

  - name: vegetative

    ec_mS_cm: [1.0, 1.8]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Tender baby leaves prefer lower light; mature leaves benefit from higher DLI for thickness.

  - name: mature
    duration_days: [30, 60]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [150, 400]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [14, 28]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [3, 6]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [5, 22]
    photoperiod_hours: [10, 16]
    ec_mS_cm: [1.2, 2.0]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Harvest frequently for baby leaves; full-leaf spinach requires more light for larger leaves.
