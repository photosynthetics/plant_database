  M창che (lamb's lettuce) is a small, tender winter salad green with a mild, nutty flavor. It prefers cool conditions and lower light relative to many salad greens, making it ideal for fall and winter production or low-light systems.

stages:
  - name: seedling
    duration_days: [6, 14]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [40, 120]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [4, 10]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [1.5, 3]

    optimal_temperature_c: [2, 18]
    photoperiod_hours: [8, 14]
    ec_mS_cm: [0.6, 1.2]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Slow to germinate in cool conditions; keep substrate moist but not waterlogged. M창che tolerates low light and benefits from cooler night temperatures for compact growth.

  - name: vegetative
    duration_days: [20, 45]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [60, 180]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [6, 12]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [2, 4]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [2, 20]
    photoperiod_hours: [8, 14]
    ec_mS_cm: [0.8, 1.4]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Harvest as rosettes or baby leaves; avoid high heat which causes bolting and bitterness. Increased light can speed growth but may reduce tenderness.

  - name: mature
    duration_days: [40, 90]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [80, 220]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [8, 14]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [2, 5]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [2, 22]
    photoperiod_hours: [8, 14]
    ec_mS_cm: [1.0, 1.8]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Best quality in cool, stable conditions. M창che is sensitive to prolonged high temperatures; provide shade or move to cooler conditions to maintain flavor and texture.
