  Mizuna is a tender, mildly peppery Japanese mustard green. It is fast-growing and adaptable to a range of light and temperature conditions, preferring cool to moderate temperatures. It performs well as baby greens and in mixed salad mixes.

stages:
  - name: seedling
    duration_days: [4, 12]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [50, 150]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [6, 12]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [1.5, 3]

    photoperiod_hours: [10, 14]
    ec_mS_cm: [0.8, 1.4]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Quick germination and establishment; maintain even moisture to avoid stress. Cooler temperatures reduce bolting tendency.

  - name: vegetative
    duration_days: [10, 30]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [100, 300]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [10, 18]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [2, 4]

    ec_mS_cm: [1.0, 1.8]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Harvest as baby leaves at the lower end or allow to reach mature leaf size. Increased light improves leaf color and compactness.

  - name: mature
    duration_days: [25, 60]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [150, 400]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [14, 24]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [3, 6]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [5, 26]
    photoperiod_hours: [10, 16]
    ec_mS_cm: [1.2, 2.0]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Mizuna tolerates slightly warmer conditions than some brassicas but will bolt in high heat or long photoperiods; shade or shorter photoperiods help extend harvest window.
