stages:
  - name: seedling
    duration_days: [3, 8]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [80, 250]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [8, 16]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [1, 2]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [18, 26]
    photoperiod_hours: [12, 16]
    ec_mS_cm: [1.0, 1.6]
    ph: [5.5, 6.5]
    notes: >
      Gradually acclimate seedlings to higher intensity to prevent burn; ensure good airflow.

  - name: vegetative
    duration_days: [10, 20]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [400, 800]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [25, 40]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [2, 3]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [20, 28]
    photoperiod_hours: [12, 16]
    ec_mS_cm: [1.6, 2.8]
    ph: [5.5, 6.5]
    notes: >
      High light accelerates growth and increases leaf density; monitor nutrients and water closely.

  - name: mature
    duration_days: [20, 45]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [600, 1200]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [30, 50]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [3, 4]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [20, 28]
    photoperiod_hours: [12, 16]
    ec_mS_cm: [1.8, 3.2]
    ph: [5.5, 6.5]
    notes: >
      Expect rapid biomass gain; manage leaf temperature and hydration to avoid tip burn.
