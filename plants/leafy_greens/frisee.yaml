description: >
  Frisée is a variety of endive with finely curled, frilly leaves and a slightly bitter, peppery flavor. It thrives in cool conditions and benefits from moderate to high light for crisp, well-developed fronds. Heat increases bitterness and can cause bolting.

stages:
  - name: seedling
    duration_days: [6, 14]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [60, 180]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [6, 14]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [1.5, 3]

    ec_mS_cm: [0.8, 1.6]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Keep substrate moist and cool; frisée seedlings appreciate steady moisture and cooler temps to promote compact growth.

  - name: vegetative

    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [12, 22]

    ec_mS_cm: [1.0, 2.0]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      Higher light encourages tighter, crisp fronds; watch for heat stress, which can make leaves more bitter.

  - name: mature
    duration_days: [35, 80]
    ppfd_umol_m2_s: [200, 450]
    recommended_dli_mol_m2_day: [16, 28]
    recommended_red_blue_ratio: [3, 6]
    co2_ppm: 400
    optimal_temperature_c: [4, 22]
    photoperiod_hours: [10, 16]
    ec_mS_cm: [1.2, 2.2]
    ph: [6.0, 7.0]
    notes: >
      For milder flavor, harvest under cool conditions; frisée can be blanched to reduce bitterness, and providing shade during hot periods helps preserve texture.
